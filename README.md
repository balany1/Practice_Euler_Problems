Building fluency in Python by solving Euler Problems

Prime number function: Uses for loop and modulus function to determine if a number is prime or not

10001st prime(Finds the 10001st prime number):

Function 1: Prime number function to test the primality of a number and if it is, append it to a list
Function 2: Checks the length of a list and compares it to user input. When length matches user input, ith element of the list is printed

div_by_1_to_20:

even_fibonacci_sum:

largest_prime_factor:

largest_product:

multiples_of_3_5:

palindromic_number:

pythagorean_triple(Finds a triple where a,b,c sum to 1000):

Function 1: Given an input, checks whether the numbers inputted form a Pythaogrean triple and appends to a list

Nested for loop to check all possible combinations for triples, these form the inputs for function 1
Code then checks each element of the triple to see if they sum to 1000


sum_of_primes(Finds sum of primes below a user input):

Function 1: Prime number function to test the primality of a number and if it is, append it to a list
Fucntion 2: Sums all elements of the list

sum_of_squares(Finds the difference between sum of squares and square sum of a number):

Function 1: Calculate square sum
Function 2: Calculate sum of squares
Calculate difference between the two results
